ok so for now this is the idea

we have PeerService which will init a Server and init a Peer

then the Peers will manage the ConnectionService which allows for connections with other Peers

we also need a "Connection" data class which handles the... other connection information

afterwards we'll do the SkipGraph stuff but this for now
