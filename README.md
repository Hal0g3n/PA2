CS5132 Programming Assignment 2 on Distributed Peer Trees (DPTree).

Our Distributed Peer Tree will be created based on 2 other data structures:
- Skip Graphs
- R-Trees

The main applications of the DPTree is to assist with faster multidimensional queries across different devices.
This is useful in the context of Peer to Peer (P2P) services.

We have made a simple UI as a proof for how this structure will speed up P2P services.
